# OpenAPI diffs — case matrix

What the `OpenAPI Operation Diffs Suite` covers, and why. Fixtures:
[packages/samples/openapi-diffs/](../../../../packages/samples/openapi-diffs/README.md); stories and
ITs: `packages/api-doc-viewer/src/{stories/openapi-diffs-suite,it/openapi-diffs-suite.*}`. Diff
rules the cases exercise: [diffs.md](diffs.md).

## Rules

| Rule | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Every displayed OpenAPI fragment | operation summary, operation ID, description, external docs, deprecated, extensions, the whole operation; every parameter location and response headers; request and response bodies, their media types and schemas; responses as a whole, each response code kind, response description and extensions; security sections, alternatives, schemes, scheme fields per type, OAuth flows and scopes. |
| Opposites next to each other | Every add has its remove, every on (`deprecated`, `required`) its off, every move A → B its B → A, with consecutive case ids. A value replace (A → B) has no reverse case: B → A shows the same rows with swapped texts. |
| Same change, same id | Parameter-like fragments (path / query / header / cookie parameters, response headers) share one case list, and so do the two bodies: `query-parameters/07-schema-to-content` and `cookies/07-schema-to-content` are the same change. A change a fragment cannot express is skipped, and its id stays unused there (`—` below). |
| Path parameters | Cannot be added, removed, made optional, or removed as a group without changing the path template, which makes `apiDiff` pair different paths (a different operation). Covered: rename (renames the template: address row replace + property rename), description, deprecated, `schema` ↔ `content`, extensions. |
| Response codes | Whole add / remove per code kind (`1XX`–`5XX`, a range, `default`); the IT selects the changed code. All other response cases change the initially selected `200`, except `description-changed-non-initial-code` (change marker on a code that is not selected). |
| JSON Schemas inside | Not fanned out (that is the JSON Schema suites' job): each body has one property add / remove pair and one schema replace; the `schema` ↔ `content` and description-precedence cases cover the parameter synthesis. |
| Display modes | One story per case; `displayMode` is a story control (default `detailed`). ITs capture every case in `detailed` and `simple` by passing the story arg — never a duplicated story or fixture. |
| Generated | Fixtures, catalogues, stories, ITs, and the matrix below come from `packages/api-doc-viewer/bin/openapi-diffs-case-definitions.mjs` via `node bin/generate-openapi-diffs-suite.mjs`. Change cases there, not in the output. |

## Matrix

<!-- BEGIN generated: node packages/api-doc-viewer/bin/generate-openapi-diffs-suite.mjs -->

251 cases; ITs capture each in `detailed` and `simple` (502 screenshots).

### Parameters and headers

One case list for every parameter-like fragment; the same id is the same change in each folder.
`—` = the fragment cannot express the change.
