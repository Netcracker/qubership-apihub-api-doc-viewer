# Design

Developer-facing design for the api-doc-viewer monorepo: requirements, display baselines,
architecture, feature designs, and review notes. **This folder is the source of truth.** Agent
skills under `agent-packages/` derive from it; when a skill or the code disagrees with a design
document, fix the disagreement explicitly — update the design first if the implementation is the
approved behaviour.

## Layout

Every API type folder has the same shape. A file or folder exists only when there is content for
it.

```text
docs/design/
  README.md
  shared/                       API-type-agnostic contracts and abstract diagrams
    architecture/
    features/
  <api-type>/                   async-api · ddlapi · jso · json-schema · graphql (legacy)
    display-coverage.md         what is shown today, what is omitted on purpose
    architecture/               four diagrams, same file names everywhere:
      data-model-plain.md
      data-model-with-diffs.md
      viewer-plain.md
      viewer-with-diffs.md
    entities/                   one file per domain entity (when the API type has a product design)
    features/                   one file per isolated feature
    notes/                      dated review and decision notes: <yyyy-mm>-<topic>.md
```

## Conventions

- **Names.** API type folders use the code's spelling (`async-api`, `ddlapi`, `jso`,
  `json-schema`). Files are kebab-case nouns; the same concept has the same file name in every
  API type.
- **Headings.** Coverage documents share the top-level headings `Sources`, `Scope`, `Pipeline`,
  `Classification tags`, `Displayed (plain)`, `Displayed (with diffs)`, `Not displayed`,
  `Triage rules`, `Regression coverage`, `Related documents`.
- **Diagrams** are Mermaid `flowchart TB`, with an `Abstract (shared)` subgraph linking the API type
  to [shared/architecture/](shared/architecture/). Small helpers are collapsed under one label.
- **Status words.** `implemented`, `planned`, `Open` (for open questions); coverage tags as defined
  in each coverage document.
- Test-fixture catalogues are not design: they live next to the fixtures, see
  [packages/samples/README.md](../../packages/samples/README.md).
- Agent-only material (traps, session lessons, review briefs) lives in `agent-packages/`.

## Workflow

Features are built test-first:

1. **Design** — add or update the feature file and the coverage document.
2. **Tests first** (`api-doc-viewer-testing`) — fixtures under `packages/samples/`, their catalogue,
   Storybook stories, and screenshot ITs; data-layer unit tests in `packages/next-data-model/tests/`.
3. **Implement** (`next-data-model-authoring`, then `api-doc-viewer-authoring`) until the tests pass.
4. Repeat 2–3 until the developer confirms the feature is done; then refresh the diagrams and the
   coverage document, and let `api-doc-viewer-using` pick up integrator-visible changes.
