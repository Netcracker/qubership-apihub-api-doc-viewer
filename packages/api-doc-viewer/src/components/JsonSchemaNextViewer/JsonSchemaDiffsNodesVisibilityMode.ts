 * because a third mode is already planned: `show-only-nodes-with-filtered-changes` (hide a node
 * unless it has a diff whose type is in a caller-supplied `diffTypes` list). See
 * `refactoring-notes.md` (agent-packages/api-doc-viewer-authoring) for the full design analysis,
 * including how much of that third mode's data-layer plumbing already exists today.
