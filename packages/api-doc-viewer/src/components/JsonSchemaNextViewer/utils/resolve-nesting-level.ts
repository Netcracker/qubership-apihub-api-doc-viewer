 * `JsonSchemaNodeDiffsAggregatorKindAny.withNestingLevelFlags`) - mirrors exactly how
 * `JsoPropertyNodeViewerWithDiffs` reads the same field for the same purpose. No
 * `undefined`/add/remove/replace branching here: the data layer already resolved that into a
 * plain boolean per side (increment vs. stay flat), including the "no diff at all" case
 * (`increaseLevel` absent -> treated as "increment", via `?? true`).
