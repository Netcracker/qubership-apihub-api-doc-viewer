/**
 * Clicks the oneOf/anyOf combiner variant option that actually contains the diff (detected via
 * the `diffs-border-shadow_*` / `diffs-round-marker_*` classes `SelectNestedNodeRow` applies to
 * changed options), instead of leaving the default `nested[0]` selection. Recurses into nested
 * combiners revealed by each click until no changed-but-unselected option remains (leaf state).
 *
 * Pure DOM, no external dependencies, so it can run identically from a Storybook `play` function
 * (browser context) or via Puppeteer's `page.evaluate()` — this is the single implementation
 * shared by both call sites. Everything it needs (constants, the render-settle helper) is
 * declared *inside* this function body rather than at module scope: `page.evaluate()` sends
 * Puppeteer's callback via `Function.prototype.toString()` and re-evaluates only that source in
 * the browser, so any reference to an outer module-level `const`/helper resolves to nothing
 * there (`ReferenceError`) even though the exact same code works fine when called directly from
 * a `play` function inside the bundled story module. Keep it this way — do not hoist any of the
 * declarations below back out to module scope.
