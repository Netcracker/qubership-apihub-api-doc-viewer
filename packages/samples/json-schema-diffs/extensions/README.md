# JSON Schema diff fixtures — extensions

Hand-written YAML pairs for screenshot-diff scenarios exercising specification
extension (`x-`-prefixed) properties — see OAS 3.0/3.1 and JSON Schema
draft-07 — in the JSON Schema Next diffs viewer. All cases are **root-only**
(no property/`items`-location split, unlike the plain `json-schema/extensions/`
suite).

- Total cases: 104 (4 types × 8 "existing 1 extension" + 4 types × 14
  "existing 2 extensions" + 8 "node diff → extension inheritance" suites × 2 cases)
- Layout: `json-schema-diffs/extensions/<suite>/<case-id>/before.yaml` and
  `.../after.yaml`
- Each file is a **standalone JSON Schema** document (not wrapped in OpenAPI).

## Cases

### Extension value catalog

Every case is built from a fixed catalog of extension keys/values, so the
same "kind" of extension always reads the same way across cases. A
"secondary" key is used whenever a case needs two coexisting extensions of
the same kind (e.g. two primitives) without a key collision.

| Kind | Primary key: value | Secondary key: value | "Replaced" value (differs from both) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| primitive | `x-internal: true` | `x-version: '1.0.0'` | `false` |
| object | `x-metadata: {owner: platform-team}` | `x-labels: {team: core}` | `{owner: growth-team}` |
| array | `x-tags: [beta, internal]` | `x-owners: [team-a, team-b]` | `[ga, public]` |
| simple JSON Schema | `x-value-schema: {type: integer, minimum: 0}` | `x-response-schema: {type: string, minLength: 1}` | `{type: boolean}` |

### Suites 1–4 — "Existing 1 `<type>` extension"

Starting state: one extension of the given type at the schema root
(`existing-1-primitive/`, `existing-1-object/`, `existing-1-array/`,
`existing-1-json-schema/`).

| Case id | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `01-add-primitive` | + 1 more primitive extension added (secondary key if the base type is already primitive) |
| `02-add-object` | + 1 more object extension added |
| `03-add-array` | + 1 more array extension added |
| `04-add-json-schema` | + 1 more simple-JSON-Schema extension added |
| `05-replace-to-primitive` | Value replaced → another primitive (same key) |
| `06-replace-to-object` | Value replaced → object (same key) |
| `07-replace-to-array` | Value replaced → array (same key) |
| `08-replace-to-json-schema` | Value replaced → simple JSON Schema (same key) |

### Suites 5–8 — "Existing 2 `<type>` extensions"

Starting state for the "removed" cases is the mixed pair `{<type>, X}` — the
outcome of the matching "1 more X added" case above. Starting state for the
"replaced"/combo cases is the same-type pair `{<type>, <type>}` (primary +
secondary key). Combo cases use two auxiliary types, cycling deterministically
through `[primitive, object, array, json-schema]` starting right after the
base type, so each of the four sections exercises different concrete type
combinations.

| Case id | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `01-primitive-removed` | Base pair `{<type>, primitive}` → primitive extension removed |
| `02-object-removed` | Base pair `{<type>, object}` → object extension removed |
| `03-array-removed` | Base pair `{<type>, array}` → array extension removed |
| `04-json-schema-removed` | Base pair `{<type>, json-schema}` → JSON Schema extension removed |
| `05-replaced-to-primitive` | Secondary extension's value replaced → primitive |
| `06-replaced-to-object` | Secondary extension's value replaced → object |
| `07-replaced-to-array` | Secondary extension's value replaced → array |
| `08-replaced-to-json-schema` | Secondary extension's value replaced → simple JSON Schema |
| `09-added-and-removed` | Secondary extension removed; a new extension (auxiliary type 1) added |
| `10-removed-and-replaced` | Secondary extension removed; primary extension's value replaced → auxiliary type 1 |
| `11-added-and-replaced` | Secondary extension's value replaced → auxiliary type 1; a new extension (auxiliary type 2) added |
| `12-both-replaced` | Primary extension's value replaced → auxiliary type 1; secondary → auxiliary type 2 |
| `13-both-added` | Starting state has no extensions → both primary and secondary extensions added at once (wholly-added group) |
| `14-both-removed` | Starting state is the same-type pair `{<type>, <type>}` → both extensions removed at once (wholly-removed group) |

### Suites 9–16 — Node diff → extension inheritance (JSON Schema Next Viewer ↔ JSO Viewer seam)

The whole-node add/remove diff (a property/array item appearing or disappearing) is rendered
by the JSON Schema Next Viewer, but the extensions attached to that node are rendered by the
(separate) JSO Viewer embedded within it. These 8 suites check that a node's "added"/"removed"
diff status correctly inherits into its JSO-rendered extensions when the whole node — including
its extensions — is inserted or deleted, across every root shape the viewer supports: plain
`object`/`array`, and `object`/`array` nested inside `oneOf`/`anyOf`/`allOf`. This is untested
by suites 1–8 above, which only cover extension *value* diffs at an already-present node.

Each suite has 2 fixed members plus (for combiner suites) one static, unchanged sibling
option:

- First member: simple primitive, no extensions (`name: {type: string}` for object suites,
  `items[0]: {type: string}` for array suites).
- Second member: simple primitive carrying 2 extensions —
  `{type: integer, x-internal: true, x-version: '1.0.0'}` (reusing the primitive kind's
  primary/secondary keys from the catalog above).
- Sibling option, `oneOf`/`anyOf` suites only: `{type: boolean}` — a genuine alternative,
  since `oneOf`/`anyOf` pick one matching branch.
- Sibling option, `allOf` suites only: `{description: 'Unchanged constraint'}` — **not**
  `{type: boolean}`. `allOf` intersects all members against the *same* instance, so a `boolean`
  sibling next to an `object`/`array` member is self-contradictory (no value can satisfy both
  types) and the viewer correctly renders the merged type as `nothing`, defeating the case. A
  type-free constraint composes with the object/array member instead of conflicting with it.

| Suite dir | Root shape |
| --- | --- |
| `object-two-properties/` | `object` with 2 properties |
| `array-two-items/` | `array` with 2 indexed items (tuple) |
| `oneof-object-two-properties/` | `oneOf: [<object-two-properties>, boolean]` |
| `oneof-array-two-items/` | `oneOf: [<array-two-items>, boolean]` |
| `anyof-object-two-properties/` | `anyOf: [<object-two-properties>, boolean]` |
| `anyof-array-two-items/` | `anyOf: [<array-two-items>, boolean]` |
| `allof-object-two-properties/` | `allOf: [<object-two-properties>, {description: 'Unchanged constraint'}]` |
| `allof-array-two-items/` | `allOf: [<array-two-items>, {description: 'Unchanged constraint'}]` |

Each suite has 2 cases:

| Case id (object suites) | Case id (array suites) | Change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `01-second-property-added` | `01-second-item-added` | before: only the first member → after: both members, second one already carrying its extensions |
| `02-second-property-removed` | `02-second-item-removed` | before: both members (second with extensions) → after: only the first member |

#### Known gap — the 4 array-shaped suites don't currently prove anything

`array-two-items`, `oneof-array-two-items`, `anyof-array-two-items`, and `allof-array-two-items`
use root-level **tuple/indexed** `items:` (a YAML list — `items[0]`/`items[1]`), mirroring
`type-changes/array-indexed-items/`. As of this writing, the JSON Schema Next diffs viewer
renders a root-level tuple array as a **text summary only** ("Tuple array with N indexed item
schema(s)", `Unique items`, `Items count`) — it does **not** render the individual indexed items
as inspectable child nodes. Confirmed by DOM inspection against the pre-existing, committed
`array-indexed-items` suite (not just these new fixtures): only one `JsonNode` element exists
for a 2-item tuple array, and the container's full content height is ~138px — there is nothing
hidden or collapsed to expand.

Practical effect: `items[1]` (the property carrying `x-internal`/`x-version`) is never rendered,
so these 4 suites' before/after screenshots will look identical regardless of whether the
extension-inheritance seam works correctly — **they cannot currently catch a regression in this
area**. They are kept anyway, deliberately, as a forward-looking regression trap: if/when the
viewer gains tuple-item rendering, these fixtures are already in place to exercise it, and their
baseline screenshots will visibly change the moment that rendering exists (which is itself a
signal worth noticing). The 4 object-shaped suites above (`object-two-properties`,
`oneof-object-two-properties`, `anyof-object-two-properties`, `allof-object-two-properties`) are
the ones that actually verify the seam today — confirmed visually (added `count` property and
its `x-internal`/`x-version` extensions correctly inherit the green "added" diff state; same for
combiner-wrapped variants) before these fixtures were committed.

Story id pattern: `{meta-id}--case-{case-id}` (for example
`json-schema-diffs-suite-extensions-existing-1-primitive--case-01-add-primitive`, or
`json-schema-diffs-suite-extensions-node-diff-to-extension-inheritance-object-two-properties--case-01-second-property-added`
for the new suites). Meta ids were derived from the title strings above and confirmed against
a built Storybook `index.json` before the IT files were written (per the
`api-doc-viewer-testing` skill's story-id verification step) — verified with
`bin/audit-story-id-mismatches.mjs`, 0 mismatches.
