# JSON Schema node key rename — agent reference

Design (source of truth): `docs/design/json-schema/features/node-key-rename.md`.

Reference for AI assistants working on a **renamed property key** (`rename` diff on the node
itself) in the JSON Schema stack: the title row shows `beforeKey` on the origin side and `afterKey`
on the changed side.

**Primary code paths**

| Layer | Role | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node-level diff styles | `rename` → content/header visible, yellow text highlighter | `next-data-model/.../node-descendant-diffs/kind-any.ts` (`buildDescendantDiffMetadata`) |
| Aggregation | no early return for an inherited `rename`; primitive nodes keep it | `next-data-model/.../node-diffs/kind-any.ts` (`aggregate`) |
| Title-row background | `rename` → `asReplaceRowColorizingDiff` | `kind-any.ts` (`aggregateTitleRowDiff`), `kind-property.ts` (`aggregatePropertyTitleRowDiff`) |
| Per-side key | `JsonSchemaRowDiffs.PropertyName.takeRenameDiff` / `resolveSideText` | `next-data-model/.../model/json-schema/tree-with-diffs/property-row-diffs.ts` |
| Whole-node vs rename | `JsonSchemaRowDiffs.NodeLevel.takeWholeNodeDiff` (node-level diff except `rename`), `JsonSchemaRowDiffs.Description.takeRowDiff` | `property-row-diffs.ts` |
| Severities | `rename` → title-row badge only, `causedAt` = before declaration path | `next-data-model/.../node-diffs-severities/kind-any.ts` |
| Viewer | `JsonSchemaNodeTitleWithDiffs` `textDiff` highlight, per-side text | `api-doc-viewer/.../SchemaNodeViewer/schema-node-title-row-shared.tsx`, `JsonSchemaNodeTitle.tsx` |
| Viewer (other rows) | description row via `Description.takeRowDiff`; `required` tag via `takeWholeNodeDiff` | `SchemaNodePlainContent.tsx`, `utils/json-schema-title-row-view-props.ts` |

**Regression**

| Mode | Suite |

## Session learnings — what was non-obvious

### 1. `apiDiff` never emits this diff for JSON Schema

`apiDiff` creates a `rename` only when a mapping resolver pairs a before key with a **different**
after key. The JSON Schema object mapping pairs equal keys only, so a changed property key is
`remove` + `add`. A `rename` comes only from a consumer that synthesizes a schema (for example one
property per OpenAPI path parameter, mapping the parameter's `name` value `replace` to a key
rename). Consequences:

- JSON Schema fixture pairs (`before.yaml` / `after.yaml` → `apiDiff`) **cannot** produce it. Unit
  tests build the merged schema by hand: put the diff into the parent's `properties[diffsMetaKey]`
  record, keyed by the **after** key, with `beforeKey` / `afterKey`. The screenshot suite uses
  OpenAPI fixtures instead: `apiDiff` maps **path** parameters by position in the path template
  (query/header parameters by name — renaming one is `remove` + `add`), and
  `stories/json-schema-diffs-suite/parameters-schema-synthesis.ts` turns the parameter `name`
  replace into a property `rename`.
- The merged schema contains only the after key, so `node.key` is the after key on both sides —
  never render the key directly when the node is renamed; use
  `JsonSchemaRowDiffs.PropertyName.resolveSideText`.

### 2. An inherited `rename` must not end the aggregation

`node-diffs/kind-any.ts` returns early after copying an inherited whole-node diff from the parent's
or container's `descendantDiffs[nodeKey]` — correct for add / remove (nothing else of the node is
compared), wrong for a rename: the renamed node is the same node and its own field diffs (type
label, flags, validation rows, extensions) must still be aggregated. Keep the `isDiffRename` guard
on both early returns, and keep the node-level diff for a primitive crawl value (boolean schema).

### 3. Do not reuse the `replace` descendant styles

In `node-descendant-diffs/kind-any.ts` a whole-node `replace` sets `isContentVisible: false` on both
sides. A `rename` has its own branch with content and header **visible**; otherwise the renamed
node's rows and children disappear. The yellow row background comes from the title-row diff
(`asReplaceRowColorizingDiff`), not from the node-level styles — the node-level diff carries only
the text highlighter used for the key.

### 4. Title-row priority

Whole-node add / remove → rename → meta flags → required → type-label field diffs. A rename is
handled by both `aggregateTitleRowDiff` (kind-any) and `aggregatePropertyTitleRowDiff`
(kind-property — it runs after `super.aggregate()` and overwrites the title-row diff).

### 5. `NODE_LEVEL_DIFF_KEY` is no longer "the whole node changed"

Before renames, any `nodeDiffs[""]` meant add / remove / replace of the whole node, and several
consumers painted **every** row from it. A rename stored there leaked onto the description row
(`buildRowDiffProps` falls back to the node-level diff by default, and that fallback even wins over
the row's own `description` diff), onto the description / nesting-indicator / extensions /
custom-annotation floating badges (severities aggregator), and hid a `required` change (tags
treated the node as wholly changed). Rule: anything that means "the whole node changed" reads
`JsonSchemaRowDiffs.NodeLevel.takeWholeNodeDiff` (or checks `isDiffAdd` / `isDiffRemove`), never the
raw key. When adding a row that falls back to the node-level diff, add a `JsonSchemaRowDiffs`
accessor built on `takeWholeNodeDiff` and pass it through `buildRowDiffProps`'s `resolveDiff`.
